The AnimateCardButton is a React component that leverages the framer-motion library to create an animated and responsive button. It responds to mouse movements by smoothly rotating along the X and Y axes as the cursor moves over it. Upon clicking, the button redirects the user to the projects page. The background animation and pulsation make the button visually appealing and interactive, providing a modern and engaging experience for React/Next.js web applications.
